# r6RecoilControl
An application that will modify a SPECIFIC lua script to handle recoil on your logitech mouse, using the GHUB


First things first, currently NO ONE has been banned for using the logitech ghub lua scripting on their mouse
It may be considered cheating, but there's no way for them to detect it
All this does is modify the LUA script, it doesn't touch the game
It will only work for the lua script I supplied, it is pretty standard recoil control.

How to use:
  First:
    Make sure you have a lua script set up for your mouse, it must be identical, save for the keybind to turn on or off the script
  Second:
    when you open it up, it won't be connected to the lua script folder, in the top left there is a folder button
    when you press the button it will open a dialog asking for the lua script folder, next to the button I have
    listed where you will find your lua script folders, just hover over the question mark
  Third:
    with it connected, you can now manage your vertical recoil config for each gun I currently have in the app
    ALWAYS remember to save after modifying values, it will not auto save


*One final note for anyone wanting to modify the project, I use the Newtonsoft.Json package for object serialization.
